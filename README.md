# TechLaunch Portfolio
Steps to create your own HTML portfolio to help you find a job.

## Create a profile picture
Take a selfie, make you look professional and smiling. Cut the image to be 512x512px and rename it to be "profile.jpg". Replace the picture in the "images" folder.

## Add your name
Open the file "index.html". Search for "Tony Montana" and replace all the ocurrencies by your own name.

## Add your bio
Create a 260 characters description talking about yourself. Mention your passions and hobbies, and possitive qualities. Add your bio to the <meta> tag "description". Add your bio to the "About" section.

## Pick the background image
Open "index.html" and search for the text "option1.jpg". Change "1" by any number from 1 to 7 to select the background that goes better with you.

## Add social media
Add links to your profile of GitHub and LinkedIn to both the circle buttons after the background image and at the future.

## Update your contact info
Update your phone, email and languages in the sections "Basic Information" and "Are you hiring?".

## Update skills
Search for the section "skill" and update "width: 80%;" and the value of the <spam> (80%) by the percentage of strenght where you feel each skill applies to you. Add/Remove the skills on the list by the ones that apply to you.

## Add projects
Select 4 to 6 strong projects of you. Open each of the projects and take a print screen of the most important page of each application. Resize each image to be 800x522px and copy it to the folder "images\projects". Create two texts for each project: A 20 characters text with the title of the project and a 25 characters text with the tech used. Clone the sections "cc-porfolio-image" and the image and both texts for each of your projects. Notice that each two projects go in a "row" and you may need to create extra rows if you have more than 4 projects. 

## Add education
Update the section "Education" with the schools you had attended before. Feel free to add/remove "education" blocks if is the case.

## Add references
If you would like your professors to give you a reference, ask Ibis and Salvi for a 400 characters text talking about you and your skills and qualities. You are welcome to add/replace with other references by adding their pictures with a size of 300x300 px in the folder "images\references".

## Post your portfolio
Push your new portfolio to GitHub and pull it into your TechLaunch server. Make sure it opens when you access to the root of the server, I.E.: "http://USERNAME.techlaunch.online". Ask your professors for help if needed.
